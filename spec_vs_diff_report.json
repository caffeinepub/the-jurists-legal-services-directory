  "summary": "The diff shows only two files modified: backend/main.mo (which appears to be application logic content, not deployment configuration) and project_state.json (which marks the deployment feature as 'pending'). No actual deployment configuration files, dfx.json updates, canister IDs, environment variable configurations, or CI/CD deployment scripts were added or modified. The deployment task (REQ-1) has not been implemented — the project_state.json explicitly shows the status as 'pending'.",

      "reason": "No deployment artifacts, dfx.json mainnet network configuration, canister IDs, environment variables pointing to mainnet canisters, or deployment scripts were added or modified. The project_state.json marks the feature as 'pending', confirming the deployment was not executed.",

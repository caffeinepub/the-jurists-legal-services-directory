  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements well. REQ-1 (tagline), REQ-2 (chatbot removal), REQ-3 (legal notice banner), REQ-4 (team section removal), REQ-5 (Cyberabad replacement), REQ-6 (full practice areas), and REQ-7 (Telangana High Court banner) all show clear implementation. However, there are minor gaps: the legal notice banner is dismissible which may undermine 'visible on all pages', the TelanganaHighCourtPage uses a white/black border rather than a gold border as suggested, and there is no true HTTP redirect from the old Cyberabad path. Overall coverage is high.",

      "requirement": "A legal notice/disclaimer banner is visible on the site (top or bottom of all pages)",
      "reason": "The implemented LegalNoticeBanner includes a dismiss button (X) that hides the banner for the session. The AC states the banner should be visible on all pages; a dismissible banner may not satisfy this requirement as users can permanently hide it during their visit.",

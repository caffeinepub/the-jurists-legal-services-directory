  "summary": "The diff shows email updates in Footer.tsx and ContactPage.tsx (REQ-1) and references to theme changes in index.css and tailwind.config.js via the file summaries. REQ-1 appears fully implemented. REQ-2 is partially evidenced — index.css and tailwind.config.js are mentioned in the file summaries as reflecting the luxury legal palette, but their actual diff content is not shown, making it impossible to fully verify the 42nd draft theme was applied across all pages. No hallucinated features are evident.",

      "requirement": "Revert the visual theme to match the 42nd draft version across all pages and components including Header, Footer, HomePage, ContactPage, AboutPage, ServicesPage, and all other visible pages; index.css and tailwind.config.js reflect the 42nd draft design tokens.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows Footer.tsx and ContactPage.tsx modified. Page-level files such as HomePage.tsx, AboutPage.tsx, ServicesPage.tsx, and Header.tsx are not in the diff. index.css and tailwind.config.js are referenced in the file summaries as updated but their actual diffs are not provided, so full verification of theme application across all pages is not possible from the evidence.",

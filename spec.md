# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the site's theme and images to the pre-v44 state, and remove the mobile number and login button from all public-facing areas of the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore the original color palette, typography, and styling from before version 44
- Restore all original images that were replaced or removed in version 44
- Remove the phone/mobile number from the Header, Footer, Contact page, and any other location it appears
- Remove the login button from both desktop and mobile navigation so it is not visible to any site visitor

**User-visible outcome:** The site looks and feels as it did before version 44, with no phone number or login button displayed anywhere to visitors.

# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the "The Jurists" frontend and backend to the Internet Computer mainnet (production network).

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the backend Motoko canister to the IC mainnet
- Deploy the frontend React application assets to the IC mainnet
- Configure the frontend to connect to the deployed backend canister ID on mainnet

**User-visible outcome:** The application is live on the Internet Computer production network, accessible via production canister URLs, with all existing routes and features functioning as expected.
